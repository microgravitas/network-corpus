SNAP: High Energy Physics - Phenomenology collaboration network

# Description
Arxiv HEP-PH (High Energy Physics - Phenomenology) collaboration network 
is from the e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between 
authors papers submitted to High Energy Physics - Phenomenology category. 
If an author i co-authored a paper with author j
, the graph contains a undirected edge from i to j. If the paper is 
co-authored by k authors this generates a completely connected (sub)graph on k nodes.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003
