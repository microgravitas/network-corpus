ICON: Columbia phone mobility

# Description
Two networks representing weighted interactions between municipalities in Colombia from 2014. 
Directed edges represent either a significant number of phones in one municipality calling phones 
in the other, or a significant number of phones that were observed in one municipality being 
observed in another within the same day. In the archive, the call network is "city_city_nedges_social," 
in the "social" subdirectory, and the mobility network is "city_city_nedges_mobility," in the "mobility" 
subdirectory.
