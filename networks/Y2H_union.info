ICON: Yu yeast interactomes (2008) 

# Description
Network of protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), 
measured by co-complex associations identified by high-throughput affinity purification and 
mass spectrometry (AP/MS). 

This is an aggregate of previous datasets by Uetz et al. (2000) and Ito et al. (2001)
