KONECT: JDK dependency

# Description
This is the software class dependency network of the JDK 1.6.0.7 framework. The
network is directed. Nodes represent classes. An edge between them indicates
that there exists a dependency between two classes. As there may be multiple
references between classes the network has multiple edges.
