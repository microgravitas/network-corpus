Uri Alon Lab: E. coli transcription network

# Description
Transcriptional regulation networks in cells orchestrate gene expression. In 
this network the nodes are operons, and each edge is directed from an 
operon that encodes a transcription factor to an operon that it directly 
regulates (an operon is one or more genes transcribed on the same mRNA). 

This is an updated data set of the data used for the Nature Genetics paper cited
below.
