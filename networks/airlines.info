Gephi: airlines

# Description
The origin of this network is illusive: its was part of the
example datasets provided with the Gephi graph visualisation soft-
ware, but the corresponding web page claims an ‘unknown origin’.
It contains 235 US airports (with geographical meta-data) and it is
reasonable to assume that the edges represent direct flights.
