# Description
Wasserman and Faust provided five network in their work on social network
analysis: Krackhardt's high-tech managers, Padgett's Florentine families, 
Freeman's EIES network, Countries trade network, and Galaskiewicz's CEOs 
and clubs network. The trade network has been exluded here since it is 
actually a collection of small networks.

Complete descriptions of these data, including references for the original sources 
of the data, can be found in Chapter 2 (pages 59- 66) and Appendix B (pages 738-755)
of Wasserman and Faust.

The network relates acquaintanceship among a group of researchers recorded at two 
time points, one before, and one seven months after the introduction to the then 
novel phenomenon of communication by computer based on the pioneering Electronic 
Information Exchange System (EIES). EIES afforded what we would call today "newsgroups" 
(collective discussions for the entire group), and more selective "electronic mail" 
(one-to-one or one-to-many). Acquaintanceship was recorded on each pair of researchers 
on a five-point scale.
