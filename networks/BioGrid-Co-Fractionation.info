Biogrid: Co-fractionation

# Description
Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Co-fractionation - An interaction is inferred from the presence of 
two or more protein subunits in a partially purified protein 
preparation (e.g. PMID: 11294905, Fig. 9). 
If co-fractionation is demonstrated between 3 or more proteins, 
then add them as a complex.
