KONECT: Advogato

# Description
This is the trust network of Advogato. Advogato is an online community platform
for developers of free software launched in 1999. Nodes are users of Advogato
and the directed edges represent trust relationships.  A trust link is called a
"certification" on Advogato, and three different levels of certifications are
possible on Advogato, corresponding to three different edge weights:
certifications as apprentice (0.6), journeyer (0.8) and master (1.0). A user
without any trust certificate is called an observer.  It is possible to trust
oneself on Advogato, and therefore the original network contains loops.
