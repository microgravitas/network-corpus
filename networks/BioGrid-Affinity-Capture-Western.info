Biogrid: Affinity Capture-Western

# Description

Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Affinity Capture-Western - An interaction is inferred when a bait protein
is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or 
epitope tag and the associated interaction partner is identified by Western 
blot with a specific polyclonal antibody or second epitope tag. 
This category is also used if an interacting protein is visualized directly 
by dye stain or radioactivity. Note that this is an in vivo experiment where 
all relevant proteins are co-expressed in the cell. If the proteins are shown 
to interact outside of a cellular environment (such as lysates exposed to a 
bait protein for pull down) this should be considered in vitro and Reconstituted 
Complex should be used. This also differs from any co-purification experiment 
involving affinity capture in that the co-purification experiment involves 
at least one extra purification step to get rid of potential contaminating proteins.
