SNAP: Autonomous systems AS-733

# Description
The graph of routers comprising the Internet can be organized into 
sub-graphs called Autonomous Systems (AS). Each AS exchanges traffic 
flows with some neighbors (peers). We can construct a communication 
network of who-talks-to- whom from the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) logs.

The data was collected from [University of Oregon Route Views Project](http://www.routeviews.org). 
The dataset contains 733 daily instances which span an interval of 
785 days from 8 November 1997 to 2 January 2000.
