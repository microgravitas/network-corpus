# Description
These are results of chess games.  Each node is a chess player, and a directed
edge represents a game, with the white player having an outgoing edge and the
black player having an ingoing edge.  The weight of the edge represents the
outcome (+1 white won, 0 draw, -1 black won).  

The network in this corpus is undirected.
