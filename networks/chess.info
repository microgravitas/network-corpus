KONECT: Chess
These are results of chess games.  Each node is a chess player, and a directed
edge represents a game, with the white player having an outgoing edge and the
black player having an ingoing edge.  The weight of the edge represents the
outcome (+1 white won, 0 draw, -1 black won).  The dataset is anonymous:  the
identity of the players is unknown, and timestamps are approximate.  Timestamps
are given to a one month precision, and may have been shifted towards the future
by an unknown amount.
