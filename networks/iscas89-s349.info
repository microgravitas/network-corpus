The ISCAS'89 benchmarks are a set of 31 digital sequential circuits. These
benchmarks  were distributed on tape to participants of the Special Session on
Sequential Test Generation, Int. Symposium on Circuits and Systems, May 1989,
and are partially characterized in F. Brglez, D. Bryan, K. Kozminski in
"Combinational Profiles of Sequential Benchmark Circuits", Proc. IEEE Int.
Symposium on Circuits and Systems, pp. 1929-1934, May 1989.
