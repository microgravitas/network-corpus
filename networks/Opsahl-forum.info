Opsahl: Facebook-like Facebook-like Forum Network

# Description
The Facebook-like Forum Network was attained from the same online community as
the online social network; however, the focus in this network is not on the
private messages exchanged among users, but on usersâ€™ activity in the forum. The
forum represents an interesting two-mode network among 899 users and 522 topics
in that a weight can be assigned to the ties based on the number of messages or
characters that a user posted to a topic.
