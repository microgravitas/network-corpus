Biogrid: Co-purification

# Description
Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Co-purification - An interaction is inferred from the identification 
of two or more protein subunits in a purified protein complex, as 
obtained by several classical biochemical fractionation steps, or 
else by affinity purification and one or more additional fractionation 
steps. 
Note that a Western or mass-spec may also be used to identify the 
subunits, but that this differs from “Affinity Capture-Western” or 
“Affinity Capture-Mass Spec” because it involves at least one extra 
purification step to get rid of contaminants (e.g. PMID: 19343713). 
Typically, TAP-tag experiments are considered to be affinity captures 
and not co-purification experiments. If there is no obvious bait-hit 
directionality to the interaction, then the co-purifying proteins 
should be listed as a complex. If only co-fractionation is demonstrated, 
i.e. if the interaction is inferred from the presence of two or 
more protein subunits in a partially purified protein preparation 
(e.g. PMID: 11294905, Fig. 9), then use “Co-fractionation” instead.
