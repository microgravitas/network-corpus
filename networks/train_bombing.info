KONECT: Train bombing

# Description
This undirected network contains contacts between suspected terrorists involved
in the train bombing of Madrid on March 11, 2004 as reconstructed from
newspapers. A node represents a terrorist and an edge between two terrorists
shows that there was a contact between the two terroists. The edge weights
denote how 'strong' a connection was. This includes friendship and co-
participating in training camps or previous attacks.
