SNAP: Arxiv COND-MAT (Condense Matter Physics) collaboration network is from 
the e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between authors papers 
submitted to Condense Matter category. If an author i co-authored a paper 
with author j, the graph contains a undirected edge from i to j. If the paper 
is co-authored by k authors this generates a completely connected (sub)graph on k nodes.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124 months). 
It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus represents 
essentially the complete history of its COND-MAT section.
