SNAP: High-energy physics theory citation network

# Description
Arxiv HEP-TH (high energy physics theory) citation graph is from 
the e-print arXiv and covers all the citations within a dataset of 
27,770 papers with 352,807 edges. If a paper i cites paper j, the 
graph contains a directed edge from i to j. If a paper cites, or is 
cited by, a paper outside the dataset, the graph does not contain 
any information about this.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 
(124 months).

The data was originally released as a part of 2003 KDD Cup.
