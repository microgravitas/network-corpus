# Description

This directed network contains proximity ratings between studetns from
29 seventh grade students from a school in Victoria. Among other
questions the students were asked to nominate their preferred classmates
for three different activities. A node represents a student. An edge
between two nodes shows that the left student picked the right student
as his answer. The edge weights are between 1 and 3 and show how often
the left student chose the right student as his favourite.
