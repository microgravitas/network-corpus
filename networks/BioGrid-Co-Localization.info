Biogrid: Co-localization

# Description
Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Co-localization - An interaction is inferred from two proteins that 
co-localize in the cell by indirect immunofluorescence only when 
in addition, if one gene is deleted, the other protein becomes 
mis-localized. 
This also includes co-dependent association of proteins with promoter 
DNA in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (write “ChIP” in 
qualification text box), and in situ proximity ligation assays 
(write “PLA” in qualification text box).
