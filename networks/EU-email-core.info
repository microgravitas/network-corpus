SNAP:  email-Eu-core network

# Description
The network was generated using email data from a large European research 
institution. We have anonymized information about all incoming and outgoing email 
between members of the research institution. There is an edge (u, v) in the network 
if person u sent person v at least one email. The e-mails only represent 
communication between institution members (the core), and the dataset does not 
contain incoming messages from or outgoing messages to the rest of the world.

This network represents the "core" of the email-EuAll network, which also contains 
links between members of the institution and people outside of the institution 
(although the node IDs are not the same).
