A network from the Gephi package. this
network represents the call-graph of Java program. It consists of 724
vertices representing packages (one vertex), classes (79 vertices), fields
(175 vertices), and methods (469 vertices). Arcs between the vertices
represent calls (from method to method) and containments (packages
to classes, between classes, and classes to methods).
