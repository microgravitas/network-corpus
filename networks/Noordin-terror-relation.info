# Description
Relationship between 79 individuals related to the Muslim extremist Noordin Top
and 65 relevant locations (in the wider sense). The locations are aggregated from 
the operations, training exercises and relevant locations listed in the dataset.

"The Noordin Top Terrorist Network Data were drawn primarily from "Terrorism in
Indonesia: Noordin's Networks," a publication of the International Crisis
Group, and include relational data on 79 individuals discussed in that
publication. The dataset includes information on these individuals'
affiliations with terrorist/insurgent organizations, educational institutions,
businesses, and religious institutions. It also outlines which individuals are
classmates, kin, friends, and co-religionists, and it details which
individuals provided logistical support or participated in training events,
terrorist operations, and meetings."

This network shows the personal relations between the members of the group.
