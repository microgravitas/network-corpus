KONECT: Windsurfers

# Description
This was a study of windsurfers on a beach in southern California during the fall of 1986.
The windsurfing community was fairly clearly divided into at least two sub-communities. 
Members of each community seemed, to some degree, to limit their interaction to 
fellow group members. Contacts between members of the two groups occurred, but these were 
less frequent. Observations of 43 individuals were made for 31 days. All interpersonal 
contacts among collections of these individuals were recorded. Then all 43 individuals 
were interviewed following the end of observation. Data on each individual's perception 
of social affiliations were collected.
