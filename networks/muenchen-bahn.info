The Munich U- and S-Bahn network reconstructed from wikipedia data
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_S-Bahn,
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_U-Bahn).

"We extracted the Munich U–and S–Bahn network from two Wikipedia
websites [72], [73]. In a first step we transformed the network by the
following rules:
• For each train line we treated each passed station of that line as
a unique node.
• If a station formally is passed by two or more lines we created
a new super node and connected it to an edge with each of the
unique line–station nodes.
In a second step we set the distance of all edges to an arbitrary unit
length. We created three graphs out of the transformed source: The
Munich U–Bahn, the Munich S–Bahn and the combined Munich U–
and S–Bahn network (cf. Figure 4)."
