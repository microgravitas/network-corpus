# Description
The Munich U- and S-Bahn network reconstructed from wikipedia data
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_S-Bahn, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_U-Bahn).
The network was obtained from the raw data by applying the following
rules:
1. For each train line in the data, every serviced station is treated as 
a node of the network

2. If a station is services by two or more lines, a new super-node
is added and connected with each of the unique lineâ€“station nodes.
