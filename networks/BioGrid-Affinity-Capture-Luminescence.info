Biogrid: Affinity Capture Luminescence

# Description
Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Affinity Capture-Luminescence - An interaction is inferred when a bait protein, tagged with luciferase, is enzymatically detected in immunoprecipitates of the prey protein as light emission. The prey protein is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or epitope tag.
