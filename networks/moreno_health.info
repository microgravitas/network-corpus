Konect: Adolescent health

# Description
This directed network was created from a survey that took place in 1994/1995. 
Each student was asked to list his 5 best female and his 5 male friends. 
A node represents a student and an edge between two students shows that the 
left student chose the right student as a friend. In the original data, a higher 
edge weights indicate more interactions and a zero edge weight shows that there is 
no common activity at all. 

The undirected version here was obtained by converting all arcs into edges.
