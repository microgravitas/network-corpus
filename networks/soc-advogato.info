KONECT: Advogato

# Description
This is the trust network of Advogato. Advogato is an online community 
platform for developers of free software launched in 1999. Nodes are 
users of Advogato and the directed edges represent trust relationships.
 A trust link is called a "certification" on Advogato, and three different 
levels of certifications are possible on Advogato, corresponding to three 
different edge weights in the original dataset.

It is possible to trust oneself on Advogato, and therefore the original 
network contained loops.
