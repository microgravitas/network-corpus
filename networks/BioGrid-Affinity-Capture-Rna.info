Biogrid: Affinity Capture-RNA

# Description

Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Affinity Capture-RNA - An interaction is inferred when a bait protein 
is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody 
or epitope tag and the associated RNA species is identified by Northern 
blot, RT-PCR, affinity labeling, sequencing, or microarray analysis. 
Note that this is an in vivo experiment where all relevant interactors 
are co-expressed in the cell (e.g. PMID: 10747033). If the protein-RNA 
interaction is detected in vitro, use “Protein-RNA” instead.
