Pajek: Wasserman and Faust datasets

# Description
Wasserman and Faust provided five network in their work on social network
analysis: Krackhardt's high-tech managers, Padgett's Florentine families, 
Freeman's EIES network, Countries trade network, and Galaskiewicz's CEOs 
and clubs network. The trade network has been exluded here since it is 
actually a collection of small networks.

Complete descriptions of these data, including references for the original sources 
of the data, can be found in Chapter 2 (pages 59- 66) and Appendix B (pages 738-755)
of Wasserman and Faust.

David Krackhardt collected cognitive social structure data from 21 management 
personnel in a high-tech, machine manufacturing firm to assess the effects 
of a recent management intervention program. The relation queried was 
"Who is a friend of X?". Each person indicated not only his or her own advice 
and friendship relationships, but also the relations he or she perceived among 
all other managers.
