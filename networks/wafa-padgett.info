Pajek: Wasserman and Faust datasets

# Description
Wasserman and Faust provided five network in their work on social network
analysis: Krackhardt's high-tech managers, Padgett's Florentine families, 
Freeman's EIES network, Countries trade network, and Galaskiewicz's CEOs 
and clubs network. The trade network has been exluded here since it is 
actually a collection of small networks.

Complete descriptions of these data, including references for the original sources 
of the data, can be found in Chapter 2 (pages 59- 66) and Appendix B (pages 738-755)
of Wasserman and Faust.

Padgett's dataset contains marital and business ties between sixteen
Florentine families.
