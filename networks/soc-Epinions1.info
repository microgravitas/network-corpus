SNAP: This is a who-trust-whom online social network of a a general 
consumer review site Epinions.com. Members of the site can decide 
whether to ''trust'' each other. All the trust relationships interact 
and form the Web of Trust which is then combined with review ratings 
to determine which reviews are shown to the user.
