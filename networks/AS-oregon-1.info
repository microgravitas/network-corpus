Dataset information
9 graphs of Autonomous Systems (AS) peering information inferred from Oregon
route-views between March 31 2001 and May 26 2001.
Dataset statistics are calculated for the graph with the lowest (March 31 2001)
and highest (from May 26 2001) number of nodes: Dataset statistics for graph

NOTE: for the UF Sparse Matrix Collection, the primary matrix in this problem
set (Problem.A) is the last matrix in the sequence, oregon1_010526, from May 26
2001.
The nodes are uniform across all graphs in the sequence in the UF collection.
That is, nodes do not come and go.  A node that is "gone" simply has no edges.
This is to allow comparisons across each node in the graphs.
Problem.aux.nodenames gives the node numbers of the original problem.  So
row/column i in the matrix is always node number Problem.aux.nodenames(i) in
all the graphs.
Problem.aux.G{k} is the kth graph in the sequence.
Problem.aux.Gname(k,:) is the name of the kth graph.
