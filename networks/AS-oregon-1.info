SNAP: Oregon-1

# Description
The original dataset contains 9 graphs of Autonomous Systems (AS) 
peering information inferred from Oregon route-views between 31 March 2001 
and 26 May 2001. The file in our collection is the snapshot from 26 May 2001.

The nodes are uniform across all graphs in the sequence in the UF collection.
That is, nodes do not come and go.  A node that is "gone" simply has no edges.
This is to allow comparisons across each node in the graphs.
