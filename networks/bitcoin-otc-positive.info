SNAP: Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network

# Description
This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a
platform called Bitcoin OTC. Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there 
is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions 
with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin OTC rate other members 
in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. 

This network contains all edges with positive weight.
