# Description
The network Roget.net is based on the file roget.dat from the Stanford 
GraphBase that contains cross-references in Roget's Thesaurus, 1879. 

Each vertex of the graph corresponds to one of the 1022 categories in the 
1879 edition of Peter Mark Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases, 
edited by John Lewis Roget. An arc goes from one category to another if 
Roget gave a reference to the latter among the words and phrases of the 
former, or if the two categories were directly related to each other by 
their positions in Roget's book.
