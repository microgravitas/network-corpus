# Description
This networks seems to based on a wikipedia voting network collected
by Leskovec, Huttenlocher, and Kleinberg (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html)
but contains much fewer nodes. 

Network Repository's description states that 
  "The dataset contains all the Wikipedia voting data from the inception of 
   Wikipedia till January 2008. Nodes in the network represent wikipedia users 
   and a directed edge from node i to node j represents that user i voted on user j."
which matches the metadata of the SNAP dataset. 

It is unclear how this network was created exaclty and it might be prudent to exlude
it from certain analyses.
