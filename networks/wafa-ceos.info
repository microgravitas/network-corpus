# Description
Wasserman and Faust provided five network in their work on social network
analysis: Krackhardt's high-tech managers, Padgett's Florentine families, 
Freeman's EIES network, Countries trade network, and Galaskiewicz's CEOs 
and clubs network. The trade network has been exluded here since it is 
actually a collection of small networks.

Complete descriptions of these data, including references for the original sources 
of the data, can be found in Chapter 2 (pages 59- 66) and Appendix B (pages 738-755)
of Wasserman and Faust.

This data gives the affiliation network of 26 CEO's and their spouses of major 
corporations and banks in the Minneapolis area to 15 clubs, corporate and cultural boards. 
Membership was during the period 1978-1981. This data is used by Wasserman and Faust.
