The German Autobahn network reconstructed from wikipedia data
(http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Bundesautobahn_als_Thema).

"We sourced the Bundesautobahn networkâ€™s junctions and end nodes
out of the Wikipedia website [71]. If we saw branches from motorway
junctions that are smaller than 500 meter long we omitted them. We
added the A71 to our graph 3 and excluded the small isolated motor-
way part from the A252. For the labels of the motorways endpoints
we applied subjective criteria. The most important change the graph
has undergone is that we mapped the varying lengths to an arbitrary
unit length."
