KONECT: Residence hall

# Description
 Cynthia Webster collected friendship data among the 217 residents living 
at a residence hall located on the Australian National University campus.
 Residents were interviewed individually at the start of the second semester.

First, they were asked to recall all of their friends who currently lived 
in the residence hall. They then were provided with a list of all residents 
and were asked to add anyone whom they also considered a friend, but had 
forgotten to include. From the complete list of friends, they were asked 
to indicate the strength of each friendship tie. Most specified three 
levels of friendship, "best friend," "close friend," and "friend." 
The data were combined to form a valued, actor-by-actor matrix of 
reported friendship relations. 

The network in this corpus simply treats every non-zero entry as an edge.
