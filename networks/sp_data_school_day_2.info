SocioPatterns: Primary school

# Description
This dataset is part of a study of contact networks in a primary school, as reported in 
the paper cited below. The original dataset comprised two weighted networks of face-to-face 
proximity between students and teachers. For each day of the study, a daily contact network 
was created: nodes are individuals and edges represent face-to-face interactions.  

The network contained in the corpus is from the second day of the study.
