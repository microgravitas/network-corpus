KONECT: Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus

# Description
This is the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus.  Nodes are English words, and a
directed link from A to B denotes that the word B was given as a response to the
stimulus word A in user experiments.  Multiple links are allowed, and the
multiplicity of an edge denotes the number of times a word has been given as a
response to another word.  In some case, the given word itself was given as a
response, leading to loops in the network.
