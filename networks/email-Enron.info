SNAP: Enron email communication network covers all the email communication 
within a dataset of around half million emails. This data was originally made public,
 and posted to the web, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its 
investigation. Nodes of the network are email addresses and if an address i sent 
at least one email to address j, the graph contains an undirected edge from i to j. 
Note that non-Enron email addresses act as sinks and sources in the network as we 
only observe their communication with the Enron email addresses.

The Enron email data was originally released by William Cohen at CMU.
