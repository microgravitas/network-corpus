Biogrid: Fret

# Description
Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

FRET - An interaction is inferred when close proximity of interaction 
partners is detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
between pairs of fluorophore-labeled molecules, such as occurs 
between CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) fusion proteins in vivo 
(e.g. PMID: 11950888, Fig. 4).
