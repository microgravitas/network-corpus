# Description
Reality mining network data consists of human mobile phone call events 
between a small set of core users at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) whom actually were assigned mobile phones for which a
ll calls were collected. 
The data also contains calls from users outside this small set of users 
to other phones of individuals that were not actively monitored and 
thus these nodes generally have fewer edges than nodes within the small 
set of users at MIT that participated in the experiment and were assigned 
phones. The data was collected collected by the Reality Mining experiment 
performed in 2004 as part of the Reality Commons project. The data was 
collected over 9 months using 100 mobile phones. 
A node represents a person; an edge indicates a phone call or voicemail 
between two users.
