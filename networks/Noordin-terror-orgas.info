Relationship between 79 individuals related to the Muslim extremist Noordin Top
and 67 relevant organisations. The organisations are aggregated from the extremist
organisations, the businesses and schools found in the original dataset.

"The Noordin Top Terrorist Network Data were drawn primarily from "Terrorism in
Indonesia: Noordin's Networks," a publication of the International Crisis
Group, and include relational data on 79 individuals discussed in that
publication. The dataset includes information on these individuals'
affiliations with terrorist/insurgent organizations, educational institutions,
businesses, and religious institutions. It also outlines which individuals are
classmates, kin, friends, and co-religionists, and it details which
individuals provided logistical support or participated in training events,
terrorist operations, and meetings."
