KONECT: Infectious

# Description
This network describes the face-to-face behavior of people during the exhibition
INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY in 2009 at the Science Gallery in Dublin. Nodes represent
exhibition visitors; edges represent face-to-face contacts that were active for
at least 20 seconds. The original data contains parallel edges dnoting 
multiple contacts, the version in this corpus exluces this data. 

The network contains the data from the day with the most
interactions.
