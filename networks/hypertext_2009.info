KONECT: Hypertext 2009

# Description
This is the network of face-to-face contacts of the attendees of the ACM
Hypertext 2009 conference. The ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia 2009
(HT 2009, http://www.ht2009.org/) was held in Turin, Italy over three days from
June 29 to July 1, 2009. In the network, a node represents a conference visitor,
and an edge represents a face-to-face contact that was active for at least 20
seconds. The original dataset contains parallel edges for multiple contacts,
these are not present in this version.
