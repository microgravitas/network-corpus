# Description
Network of physiological interactions among brain regions in a mouse. One (Supp Table 2, "s3") is a bipartite network of injection sites and target regions; edges weighted by normalized projection volume. The other (Supp Table 3, "s4") is a network of model-based projection strengths among regions. Regions are also annotated with volume and brain-space location
