Biogrid: Affinity Capture-MS

# Description

Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Affinity Capture-MS - An interaction is inferred when a bait protein is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or epitope tag and the associated interaction partner is identified by mass spectrometric methods. Note that this in an in vivo experiment where all relevant proteins are co-expressed in the cell
