Biogrid: Co-crystal Structure

# Description
Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Co-crystal Structure - An interaction is directly demonstrated at the 
atomic level by X-ray crystallography (e.g. PMID: 12660736). 
This category should also be used for NMR or Electron Microscopy (EM) 
structures, and for each of these cases, a note should be added indicating 
that it's an NMR or EM structure. If there is no obvious bait-hit 
directionality to the interaction involving 3 or more proteins, then 
the co-crystallized proteins should be listed as a complex.
