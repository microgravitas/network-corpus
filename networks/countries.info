KONECT: Countries

# Description
This is the bipartite network of entities from DBpedia and their affiliated
countries. Each edge in the network connects an entity (such as a person) with a
country associated with that person. The edges correspond to the
relationships in [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country). The countries
include former countries, empires and kingdoms as well as disputed country-like
entities; therefore, the number of country-nodes is much higher than the number
of presently existing countries.
