Seierstad and Opsahl collected data on the makeup of board of directors of
384 Norwegian companies in the time from 2002 to 2012. Their data is a monthly
collection of director-board and director-director connections.

We aggregated all data into two networks: boards_gender_1m contains all
director-director connections and boards_gender_2m contains all director-board
connections.
