Biogrid: Biochemical Activity

# Description

Biogrid is a regularly updated collection of biological interactions
between proteins, genes, chemicals and model organisms.
All Biogrid networks in this corpus are taken from version 3.5.176.

Biochemical Activity - An interaction is inferred from the biochemical effect of one protein upon another in vitro, for example, GTP-GDP exchange activity or phosphorylation of a substrate by a kinase. The “bait” protein executes the activity on the substrate “hit” protein. A Modification value is recorded for interactions of this type with the possible values Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, Sumoylation, Dephosphorylation, Methylation, Prenylation, Acetylation, Deubiquitination, Proteolytic Processing, Glucosylation, Nedd(Rub1)ylation, Deacetylation, No Modification, Demethylation
