Goh et al. (`The human disease network', PNAS 104:21)
created a bipartite graph containing 1777
genes and 1284 genetic disorders listed by OMIM 3 . An edge between a
gene and a disease indicates a known correlation between the expres-
sion of the gene and the disease. The network data itself was obtained
from the Gephi package and contains 1419 vertices and 2738 edges. It
is unclear why the network is smaller than described in the original
paper, potentially it is simply the largest connected component.
